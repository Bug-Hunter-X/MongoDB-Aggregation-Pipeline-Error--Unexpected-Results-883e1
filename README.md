This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: unexpected results due to incorrect usage of the $unwind and $group stages. The bug.js file contains the erroneous code, while the bugSolution.js file provides the corrected version.

The primary issue lies in the $unwind stage, which can produce unexpected results or errors if there are no matching documents in the looked-up collection. This can lead to data loss or incomplete aggregations. The solution involves handling cases where no matches are found. Additionally, the $group stage's behavior needs careful consideration depending on the data and previous stages. The solution provides a more robust aggregation pipeline that addresses these issues.
